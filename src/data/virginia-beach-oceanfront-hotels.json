This early in the morning, the wide stretch of golden sand that fronts the three-mile-long Virginia Beach Boardwalk is mostly deserted. There&#8217;s a couple out for a stroll, pausing every so often to pick up sea shells. Nearby a woman is fiddling with her headphones, jogging in place.</p></p><p><p>The water is warm, and past the breaking waves, calm, so I swim out and float on my back as the sky turns a brilliant blue. In a few hours this wide swath of sand and deep blue sea will be buzzing. From above, it&#8217;ll resemble a brightly colored tapestry with rows of people on chairs and towels; bobbing in the sea or biking along the boardwalk beyond it. The air will smell of sunscreen and funnel cakes and french fries; be filled with the happy screech of children, the beats of competing hits blaring from personal speakers. It will be loud and chaotic and fun.</p></p><p><p>This is what I love most about Virginia Beach &#8212; the constantly shifting energy. You can go from solitude to party in a matter of hours and have memorable experiences with both. These eight Virginia Beach oceanfront hotels allow you to effortlessly enjoy it all.</p></p>"

The 167 rooms and suites here are clean and contemporary with at least partial sea views from floor-to-ceiling windows leading out to balconies. The decor features pops of bold colors and framed local photography &#8212; in one room a plush red armchair fronts a photo of the King Neptune statue that graces the beachfront.</p><p>You can hang out at the beach, but if you&#8217;re craving a soak <em>sans</em> sand, then head to the hotel&#8217;s indoor and outdoor swimming pools and plop a squat in a chaise lounger set over the edge of the pool. There&#8217;s also a sun deck on the third floor that offers sweeping ocean views and people watching on the boardwalk below.</p><p>When it&#8217;s time for dinner, the house restaurant, Lager Heads, serves some of the best burgers on the boardwalk. The menu includes creative choices like the Crab Benedict Burger (a beef patty topped with crab meat and smoky hollandaise sauce) and the Triple Ale Turkey Burger offers up a turkey burger with ale battered zucchini and BBQ sauce. They also offer a carefully curated collection of microbrews from across the country that go down smooth on a hot summer day.</p>"

Beyond the 24-foot-tall bronze sculpture, the park is known for free nightly summer concerts from its stage adjacent to the patio for Catch 31, which is one of two restaurants at the <a href=\"https://www.trivago.com/virginia-beach-35094/hotel/hilton-virginia-beach-oceanfront-74522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Hilton Virginia Beach Oceanfront</strong></a>. The grassy park also hosts a number of seasonal festivals. Come in May for the International Wine Festival or in August for Coastal Craft Beer.</p><p>Back at the Hilton, you&#8217;ll find a relatively luxe, mid-sized resort in a high-rise building with rooms and suites done up in a contemporary style, many with sea-facing balconies. There&#8217;s a rooftop infinity swimming pool and bar that you shouldn&#8217;t skip. When the sun begins to set the sky turns all shades of pink and purple and makes the water glow as the lights of the boardwalk turn up. Although the sun doesn&#8217;t sink directly over the sea in Virginia Beach (that happens over on the Chesapeake Bay side), the colors are still stupendous.</p><p>Afterward, head to the aforementioned Catch 31 for fresh Chesapeake Bay oysters or a wood-oven baked flatbread pizza. Grab a seat on the patio by the fire pit to listen to the live music from one of Neptune Park&#8217;s free summer concerts. The other on-site restaurant, Salacia, is more formal. It focuses on pairing a glass of fine wine with steak and seafood and makes for a wonderful spot to celebrate a romantic milestone.</p>"

Also onsite is Ultra Craft Cocktails Lounge, which has a sophisticated look and inventive cocktails like an Orange Creamsicle martini.</p><p>If you&#8217;re staying at Ocean Beach Club, you have no excuse not to hit up <a href=\"http://www.pocahontaspancakes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pocahontas Pancakes</a> — a local institution just a block away (head north on Atlantic Ave and make the first left on 35th St). There&#8217;s a line out the door most mornings, but it&#8217;s the worth the wait for the best breakfast in town. The pancakes are known for their fluffiness and one of the most popular items on the menu. Get some topped with everything from bananas to chocolate chips and sausage links. Or try a breakfast sandwich &#8212; two eggs over hard with cheese, bacon on a giant English muffin with a side of home fries is a surefire hangover cure.</p>"

But just because you save on lodging doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re roughing it. Many suites come <a href=\"http://magazine.com/us-jacuzzi-hotel-rooms/\">equipped with a Jacuzzi tub</a> in the bathroom where you can relax after the kids go to bed.</p><p>Hotel amenities include a heated indoor swimming pool on the top floor, but it&#8217;s small, so many guests choose to just swim in the ocean out front. There are also two onsite restaurants. Fish Bones is dinner only and features an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet. Jumpin&#8217; Shrimp is open for three meals and offers something for everyone/ Choose from pasta dishes to sandwiches, burgers, and the specialty protein &#8212; shrimp from Florida&#8217;s gulf coast.</p>"
